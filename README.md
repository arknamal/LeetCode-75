These are my submissions for the LeetCode 75 course on leetcode.com
I have tried to use the best solution I could come up with but in some cases, I just solved the question and moved on to come back later and improve when I have gone through the course once.

IMPORTANT NOTE: There is a slight chance that some code might not be in the best working form as most of the times, it is just a copy of what I submitted on leetcode with minor tweaks for local environment. If you need to test the code, then add a main function creating an object of Solution class and calling its public function. Pass the Example and Test Cases (if available) valuse one at a time or in a loop - the Examples are present in the comment/problem description.
